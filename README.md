## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shafan, and I am a new developer, most commonly workinng on web development including HTML, CSS, and JS. Right now, I'm learning about API calls.
I have a website (WIP), which isn't done yet as well; https://s1hiro.github.io/website. Check it out if you'd like!

Right now, I am employed at <i>Bloomberg<i>, as a <i>Junior Coder<i>. I am taking a training course in Python essentials and GitHub collaboration for it now. (as of 8/5/25)

I also LOVE cats;

Along with that, I have a few app ideas (most unworked on so far because I'm  busy with ASC and my job), but I will be uploading a basic 2d collision sim soon.
I am into math, chemistry, physics, and logic based things (along with gaming!).

Right now, not very frequently, but I am working on making a local 8ball 2 player game, which is going to be a very barebones version of 8ball using my 2d collisions sim.
