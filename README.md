## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shafan, and I am a new developer, most commonly workinng on web development including HTML, CSS, and JS. Right now, I'm learning about API calls.
I have a website (WIP), which isn't done yet as well; https://s1hiro.github.io/website. Check it out if you'd like!

I also LOVE cats;
